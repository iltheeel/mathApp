        >It’s a tedious life you’re living in your little town of Al Gebra. For as long as you can
        remember, you’ve had the same routine; before dawn, you wake up, milk your family’s cow
        Ahmes, and scatter a few natural numbers about the pasture for your chickens. By the time
        the sun climbs above the horizon, you’re yawning, and it’s not because you’re tired. If
        someone drew a vertical line down the plane of your life, it would hit you twice-- you just
        can’t function like this anymore.
