        >It’s a tedious life you’re living in your little town of Al Gebra. For as long as you can
        remember, you’ve had the same routine; before dawn, you wake up, milk your family’s cow
        Ahmes, and scatter a few natural numbers about the pasture for your chickens. By the time
        the sun climbs above the horizon, you’re yawning, and it’s not because you’re tired. If
        someone drew a vertical line down the plane of your life, it would hit you twice-- you just
        can’t function like this anymore.
        Seriously, if you have to derive the quadratic formula one more time, you might just go the
        way of . It’s hard to be rational when the only new math you get comes with the arrival of
        Euclid and Hipparchus’s Traveling Circles. Besides, even they just left with their
        trigotigers and trapezoid artists, and they won’t be back for another year.
	    Sighing, you remind yourself that at least your world is safe. You’ve got a system. More
        specifically, you’ve got this system of equations. Still, if it’s anything to judge by,
        your life is getting more and more boring more and more rapidly.
