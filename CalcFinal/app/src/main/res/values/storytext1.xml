    #page 1 story, PLEASE FIX PI EQUATION THING
    <string
        name="page1_story"
        >It’s a tedious life you’re living in your little town of Al Gebra. For as long as you can
        remember, you’ve had the same routine; before dawn, you wake up, milk your family’s cow
        Ahmes, and scatter a few natural numbers about the pasture for your chickens. By the time
        the sun climbs above the horizon, you’re yawning, and it’s not because you’re tired. If
        someone drew a vertical line down the plane of your life, it would hit you twice- you just
        can’t function like this anymore.
        \Seriously, if you have to derive the quadratic formula one more time, you might just go
        the way of pi[FIX EQUATIONS]. It’s hard to be rational when the only new math you get comes
        with the arrival of Euclid and Hipparchus’s Traveling Circles. Besides, even they just left
        with their trigotigers and trapezoid artists, and they won’t be back for another year.
	    Sighing, you remind yourself that at least your world is safe. You’ve got a system. Still,
        your life is getting more and more boring more and more rapidly.

    #page 2 story
    <string name="page2_story"
        >You’re sitting in the center of your family’s stem-and-leaf plot, scarfing down the same
        lunch you eat every day, when you hear footsteps pounding down the road from town. “Listen,
        he’s here!” It’s your friend Ada, and she’s still panting, having taken the trail at a
        sprint. As soon as she catches her breath, she starts to bounce on her toes. You find your
        head nodding up and down rapidly to follow her.
        \“Who’s here?”
        \“I thought he was a myth, but no, it’s him! Here and in the flesh!”
        \“Okay, but who?”
        \She takes a deep breath. “The integrator of integrals, the differentiator of derivators,
        the calculator of calculus! And he’s here!”
        \“So you’ve said,” you begin automatically, but then the news sinks in. “Hang on, you mean
        to tell me that the Eminent Shay is here? In this town? In Al Gebra?”
        \“Yes!” She starts to pull on your arm, yanking you towards the road, but you’re already
        shaking your head.
        \“There’s no way. Why would he be here?”
        \“I don’t know, but you’ve got to come. I’ll show you. I promise!”
